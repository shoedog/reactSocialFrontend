/*
 Here we use an Immutable List object to store our state
 (though a more complex app would probably have a more elaborate structure),
 and return a newly transformed version depending on the action.

 Redux isnâ€™t very opinionated, and only has two expectations of its redeucers:
 1. The reducer has the signature (state, action) => newState.
 2. The reducer does not mutate the state it is given, but returns a new one
